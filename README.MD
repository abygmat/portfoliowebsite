## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Aby George Mathew** — an aspiring Python developer focused on building real-world applications and improving my problem-solving skills.

> _"I may be at the beginning of my coding journey, but I’m driven, resilient, and focused on becoming a confident and capable developer. I don't give up — I level up."_

I'm currently learning Python through practice-based learning:  
- 🧠 Solving LeetCode problems  
- 🔨 Building Streamlit apps  
- 🧪 Trying hands-on mini projects
